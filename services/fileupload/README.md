	mime_type: string;
	owner: {
		type: 'user';
		identifier: string;
	};
}

interface Response {
	id: string;
	upload_url: string;
}
```

#### `confirm_upload`

Confirms that the file has been uploaded, until this is called an uploaded file can not be used. This will also validate that the uploaded file matches the data that was provided in the `create_upload` endpoint.

**Contract**

```typescript
interface Request {
	file_id: string;
}

type Response = null;
```

#### `get_file`

Gets a file object by its ID. If `include_access_url` is set to `true`, then the `presigned_access_url` will be included in the response.

If `access_url_expiry_seconds` is set to a number, then the `presigned_access_url` will expire after that many seconds. If it is set to `null`, then the URL will have a default expiry time of 15 minutes.

**Contract**

```typescript
interface Request {
	file_id: string;
	include_access_url: boolean;
	access_url_expiry_seconds: number | null;
}

interface Response {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	size: number;
	mime_type: string;
	owner: {
		type: 'user';
		identifier: string;
	};
	presigned_access_url: string | null;
}
```

#### `get_many_files`

Gets many files by ID.

If `include_access_url` is set to `true`, then the `presigned_access_url` will be included in the response.

If `access_url_expiry_seconds` is set to a number, then the `presigned_access_url` will expire after that many seconds. If it is set to `null`, then the URL will have a default expiry time of 15 minutes.

If `allow_deleted` is `true` then deleted files will be included. If `false`, then if a deleted file is requested an error will be returned.

If `owner` is provided it will filter the results to only include file owned by the specified user.

**Contract**

```typescript
interface Request {
	file_ids: string[];
	owner: {
		type: 'user';
		identifier: string;
	} | null;

	allow_deleted: boolean | null;
	include_access_url: boolean;
	access_url_expiry_seconds: number | null;
}

interface Response {
	files: {
		id: string;
		name: string;
		size: number;
		mime_type: string;
		owner: {
			type: 'user';
			identifier: string;
		};

		presigned_access_url: string | null;
	}[];
}
